Researching opt. IoT network at home

**LoRa**
Site showing LoRa-coverage in Skane: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community/skane/

**2x design paths**
LTE (GSM/2/3G) or LoRa
Easiness and HW-availability as decision req. 

What would I like to build?
  **Irrigation and sensor station for hops production**
    Description:
      Activate drip irrigation from rain barrel depending on outdoor conditions. 
      
    Properties:
      - Activate relay to open solenoid valve
      - Temperature and humidity
      - Soil moist
      - Water level in the water barrel.   
  
  **Sensor suit and flow measurement for a water fountain in stables**
    Description:
      Sensor suit to automate maintenance and add warning system for stable management
    
    What would you like to measure?
      - Water flow
      - Temperature (-20 to +30 centigrades) 
      - Air pressure (have automatic warning when you see pressure drop)
