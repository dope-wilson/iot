**LoRa**
Site showing LoRa-coverage in Skane: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community/skane/

**2x design paths**
LTE (GSM/2/3G) or LoRa
Easiness and HW-availability as descision req. 

What would I like to build?
  **Irrigation and sensorstation for hops production**
    Descritpion:
      Activate drip irrigation from rain barrel depending on outdoor conditions. 
      
    Properties:
      - Activate relay to open solonoid valve
      - Temperature and humidity
      - Soil moist
